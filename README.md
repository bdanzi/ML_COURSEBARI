# ML_COURSEBARI

The `ClassTrainingData5SigFigs.txt` file contains 30k examples, each having the first column with the true label and 23 inputs.
This is used by a ML class in Bari for testing different Machine Learning algorithms and their performance

## Instructions

In the `ML_COURSEBARI\` directory of this repository:

```bash
$ python Classifier_FraBru.py
```

The command will produce:
- ROC curves
- Loss function vs Trainsize 
- MLP score vs Trainsize 

Examples of the plot produced are stored in the `Plots_NNtraining\` directory for the usage of a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) implemented by using scikit-learn package.
